Working at Kidz Kollege with these wonderful kiddos is the best experience of my life which I will continue </p><p style="font-size:18px;">I strongly believe in giving the best educational foundation to your child that will help him/ her to build better skills for primary and secondary school.

A teacher shapes a child into being a better person. Teaching children has always been my passion. Along the way you just find new surprises/stories everyday just by being with them. Before I became a teacher, I had no idea you could fit so many kids in one heart. Isn't that amazing ? That is why it is said that "To teach is to touch a life forever".<span class="dots" id="philippa_dots">...</span></p>
               <div class="more" id="philippa_more"><p style="font-size:18px;">And by that children inspire me to do better in my life. In teaching children you also teach yourself.I believe that every child needs a champion in their life and a teacher is one who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection and insists they become the best they can possibly be.And with that, there is nothing more satisfying than a sweet lovely smile and a warm cozy hug you get at the end of day. Knowing the child has acquired knowledge and is going to inspire others.</p></div><a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="ShowMore('philippa')" id="philippa_btn">More >></a></div>

               <div class="col-md-9"><p style="font-size:18px;">I am very humbled and honored to share my teaching passion. </p><p style="font-size:18px;">I share in this amazing school community, dedication to caring for our students every day while providing them with a meaningful learning environment. Although I am an educator, I am also a mother to my students. I firmly believe that every child can exceed and that the cooperation between home and school builds trust and self-esteem in students.</p><p style="font-size:18px;">So, our students can use their highest potential to shape their future, consequently, the future of our community and our nation.<span class="dots" id="nasra_dots">...</span></p>
               <div class="more" id="nasra_more"><p style="font-size:18px;">With my goals of advancing the culture of excellence at Kidz Kollege, I am devoted to continually exploring new ideas to meet the needs of all students and to interact with parents and community members more efficiently.</p><p style="font-size:18px;">I'm genuinely in love with my profession, being in this field for 25 years is not just a job but a commitment to making the world a better place, and that's at the core of who I am.  I give my students the good and the bad:</p><p style="font-size:18px;">I don't sugarcoat experiences, and students respond positively to this authenticity. The authentic experiences shared are meant to be learned from because they make a lasting impression on my students while sparking self-reflection. I ask my students to dig deep as to why they choose to do each and everything and what inspires them.</p><p style="font-size:18px;">The work i do in the classroom gives structure and understanding to what happens in life, and I am constantly drawing parallels between the two. </p><p style="font-size:18px;">I strongly believe that effective learning starts with learner relevance, and every subject can prove valuable once a student sees a connection between the content and their life. I simply highlight students' progress with recognition and encouragement, as it adds meaning beyond learning the subject matter.</p><p style="font-size:18px;">The good news is … Excitement can be contagious! Expressing my passion for teaching grabs my students' attention and drive engagement.</p><p style="font-size:18px;">I Love what I teach, and my students love it too, because it's that enthusiasm that can guide students towards a meaningful learning. </p><p style="font-size:18px;">It reaches my students through the energy I  show in class, and gives students the fuel to stay connected. </p><p style="font-size:18px;">I believe in constantly keeping concepts fresh and applicable to their every-day lives making it fun and meaningful! My excitement for what I teach is obvious, and my students can see it and feel it. The best way I feel for students to discover areas of strength is giving opportunities to delve into physical, intellectual and creative activities outside their comfort zone. The more they try, the more opportunities they'll have to discover their passion.  I encourage communication, friendship, kindness, thoughtfulness and the capacity to think of a moment that you'll never forget, then consider what made it so meaningful while improving upon their critical thinking skills.  </p><p style="font-size:18px;">To conclude, my door is always open to my students and parents,<br/><br/>I sincerely welcome conversation and input to keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrate our  collective successes.</p></div><a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="ShowMore('nasra')" id="nasra_btn">More >></a></div>

             <p style="font-size:18px;">Kidz Kollege relies on professional input and expertise of a range of staff, and "support staff" is a generic title for junior staff.Some work alongside teachers and some work behind the scenes to ensure that there is an efficient infrastructure within which effective teaching and learning can take place.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">They foster a supportive atmosphere. Often, it's their small actions that count the most and help maintain the balance. Day in - day out they are found busy supporting, caring, and looking after the well-being of all the children.</p>
