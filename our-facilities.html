        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Our computer lab has eight desk-top computers and a range of developmentally appropriate educational software to enhance learning in our classes. IT sessions means lots of new skills to learn and games that teach standards rather than just teaching keyboarding or computer skills. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">We emphasize on teaching kids how to think what makes sense when using a computer, which is extremely important in addition to using it to teach content like math or using skills in the computer lab. </p>

        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Being safe in and around water is such an important life skill and we are so excited to be able to offer this activity for our children as part of our program. Our families have been so supportive in helping us to get this up and running. Children have weekly swimming lessons at the big pool where they learn valuable water skills for life and have fun at the small pool. The little ones have so much fun starting to build their confidence in water.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;"><br/>
          Over the time, children learn about water safety as well as basic swimming techniques such as learning how to tread water and how to float. Our swimming instructor is amazing, she is very passionate about teaching children potentially life-saving skills. The swimming lessons are facilitated in small groups so children get individual attention. </p>

        <h3 style="color:#363b91; font-size:30px;" class="m-0 pb-10">Softroom</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Our soft room is designed to provide different and interesting physical challenges for children. Holistic activities are executed to address the entirety of the child's health, focusing on building functional strength and developing gross motor skills. It is imperative to encourage children to do gymnastics as it is one of the best investments. We get them started early on the path to a lifetime of flexibility, including structurally positive active play that involves moderate to vigorous bursts of high energy to raise their heart rate and make them "huff and puff". </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">We consider what's best for the child and what's developmentally appropriate. Children learn to tumble like a champ, build strength, develop balance, improve flexibility, swing with big smiles, learn to vault, leap high, master jumps, and love every minute of it! </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">This helps children learn self-discipline, good manners, kindness, sharing, and taking turns, while developing a healthy self image through the sport of gymnastics.
        
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;"> We have witnessed that children overcome their fear of falling in the soft room and this builds on their confidence especially those who hold fright in outdoor equipment; have overcome the fear of going on the slides, climbing wall, and even riding bicycles. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;"> Combining academics, physical fitness, and pro-social interaction will help children reach their full potential, enjoy learning, and begin life physically fit! </p>

        <h3 style="color:#363b91; font-size:30px;" class="m-0 pb-10">Classes </h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Our classes are equipped with age-appropriate educational materials and activities. It's a well-prepared environment with different corners- each one is designed for a particular type of skill learning. Our children have access to cognitive, imaginary, discovery, reading and relaxing corners. We look at the environment from our children's perspectives to make sure everything is accessible to them. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">We have a dynamic schedule, every day, they discover and explore the world through science; learn about and recognize number concepts from concrete to abstract through mathematics; explore places they have never been before through reading stories and imaginative play; develop creativity through arts and crafts.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">show their talents through singing and dancing at the music class; stay fit and healthy as they coordinate their movements during P.E and above all, find themselves socializing and making friends. We prepare our children for different stages of their life and become autonomous. In other words, they develop their capacities to feed, dress themselves and acquire good hygiene and eating habits.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Develop a sense of the world. They learn the relationship between objects, find solutions, negotiate, and learn differences & similarities.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Express themselves, acquire a greater vocabulary, and progress towards a better understanding of language in all its forms.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;"> Develop a sense of self. They develop their self-confidence, learn to live with others, respect the rules and resolve conflicts.</p>

        <h3  style="color:#363b91; font-size:30px;" class="m-0 pb-10">Playground</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Our playground is a place of adventure, joy, and imagination, where children create memories to carry with them for the rest of their lives. We ensure these are happy memories, rather than a recollection of various bumps and scrapes earned by using unsafe equipment or playing rough. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Children are found engrossed at the sound wall, water wall, dome, swings, slides, and the climbing wall. In addition to helping body strength, it's a form of exercise. It gives them a greater sense to stimulate balance, psychomotricity and coordination in the long run while getting rid of the fear of falling and to know where their limits are.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Our playground surroundings are closely supervised, cleaned, and checked after every interval to disinfect and look for any dangerous or worn-out equipment, such as hinges where little fingers can get trapped or even holes children may have dug. Children love to push their limits, but often don't know what those limits are. We have our teachers and support staff all over the ground to meet safety standards and watch children as they play and guide them towards age-appropriate equipment so everyone can enjoy and have fun. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Nothing sounds more joyful than the happiness on the children's faces and the sound of bliss in their voices show how much they enjoy play and engaging with their friends to improve social and collaboration skills.</p>

        <h3  style="color:#363b91; font-size:30px;" class="m-0 pb-10">Imaginary Room </h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Our imaginary room is a place children can go to imagine, be creative and pretend to be anyone or do anything! This is powerful for our little learners. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">It is a place that promotes high-level thinking, problem solving, negotiation, co-operation, collaboration,
          
          understanding of others, turn taking and improve vocabulary. Children can learn and develop skills in all learning domains (language, literacy, math, science, social studies, fine motor, gross motor, and social skills) through pretend play. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">The set-up of our imaginary room is not the same all year as children get bored quickly. Based on the season and children's interest, we change it into a new place and have it totally different by adding up props based on the current theme. At times children help us brainstorm what props we need to add and who they can pretend to be. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">We provide a variety of dress up clothes, accessories, cooking materials, shopping, hospital, restaurant etc. making pretend play more fun and realistic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 mt-10" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800"> <img src="images/facilities-7.jpg" class="img-responsive thumbnail pull-right ml-10 red-box" style="margin-bottom:0">
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">Plus, all the putting on and taking off is great for strengthening fine motor muscles.  Clothing and accessories are a fabulous way to infuse other cultures into our classroom too! </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Pretend play allows different perspectives to be taken during which ideas and emotions are moulded and rearranged. It is a major feature of a child's social and cognitive development. Children are learning and developing many different and important life skills enhancing their capacity for cognitive flexibility and ultimately, creativity. We give them the opportunity to practice using their imagination to exercise their brain, train it to think creatively and to learn how to think as well as express for themselves. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">The ability to use our imagination is a cognitive skill that we all require throughout life, and we encourage children to learn how to do this from the start with frequent opportunities for imaginative play. It is because of the development of the imagination during childhood that we as adults become capable of carrying out most of the tasks that daily life requires. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Pretend play also benefits children hugely in developing their self-esteem and self-awareness. There is a sense of freedom which flows from the realization that you can be anything by just pretending and children love this! </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">It's a safe and secure way to experiment and test boundaries and build confidence. It is fascinating to listen to our children interact with their friends. They often come out with words or phrases that we had no idea they knew! </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">They can do very amusing impersonations of their parents, careers, and teachers too! Memories are formed through imaginative play.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">The Support Centre </h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">Our Support Center is a tutorial section of the school in which children engage in hands-on activities that are thoughtfully planed and designed for reinforcement of concepts in an interesting and productive manner.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">Children visit the Support Center to strengthen particular skills and working memory as it offers one-on-one assistance in areas of deficiency for those who require. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">This center runs within the school hours to ensure children keep up with the coursework.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">With the help of our dedicated and compassionate teachers in charge of the center,children are kept up-to-date with the school benchmarks.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">We get to the bottom of the topic to help children successfully navigate, access helpful resources and  prepare them well to advance. We take it to the next level to reach important learning milestones  focusing largely on mastering and staying on track with the curriculum. This makes them
          feel successful, and that absolutely spurs them on. </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">The Support Center sets a strong foundation for children's educational journey.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">"WE DON'T MOVE BACKWARDS IN COMING FORWARD!!"</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;text-align: justify;">And that's the spirit of our Support Center</p>
