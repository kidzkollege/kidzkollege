To Baba KK, Ms Bindu, Brother Nikil, the dedicated deputy heads, the passionate teachers, the loving
staff, the caring askaris, and every single person who has touched Zaynab's journey thank you, from the
depths of our hearts.<br/>
As parents, there are moments in life that stay with you forever and watching Zaynab grow, laugh, learn,
and shine at Kidz Kollege is one of those unforgettable blessings. This journey has been one of our
proudest chapters, and also one of the most emotional. It's hard to believe how quickly time has passed.
What once felt like the beginning has suddenly become a goodbye.<br/>
From her first steps through the school gates to her confident final performance, we've seen a
transformation that moved us beyond words. Zaynab blossomed in ways we could only hope for and it's
all because of the love, patience, and guidance she received from each of you.<br/>
To all her teachers from Dancing Dolphins to Smart Sharks thank you for not only teaching her but truly
seeing her. For nurturing her spirit, encouraging her voice, and giving her the space to grow with
confidence and kindness. You gave her roots, and now, because of you, she has wings.<br/>
To the support staff, duty teachers, and askaris thank you for every smile, every helping hand, and every
quiet moment of care that often goes unnoticed but is always deeply felt.<br/>
And to the leadership to those who built this school not just with bricks, but with love thank you for
creating a place that felt like home. A place where children are not only educated, but deeply cherished.
This goodbye is not easy. But it's filled with immense gratitude, love, and pride. Thank you for being part
of Zaynab's foundation a part she will carry with her wherever she goes.<br/>
With all our love and appreciation,</p>

From her early days in Dancing Dolphins to her time now in Smart Sharks, every teacher she has
encountered has played a meaningful role in shaping the bright, confident, and curious little girl she is
today. We are so grateful for the love, guidance, and patience you've shown her throughout the years.<br/>
A very special thank you to Ms. Rabia and Ms. Preeyal, for your incredible support and dedication. Your
kindness and encouragement have made her final nursery year truly memorable.<br/>
Today's graduation was a beautiful celebration—full of joy, pride, and love. It was truly a blast, and we'll
cherish it always. Though Sabah is now moving on to primary school in a new place, she will carry the
warmth, values, and lessons from Kidz Kollege in her heart forever.Thank you for everything.</p>
