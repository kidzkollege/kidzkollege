they have poured into preparing the children for the show.<br/>
It was truly a joy to watch not just our own child, but every single performer shine with so much grace
and happiness on stage.<br/>
One of the highlights for us was when the music briefly stopped during their performance but the
children did not panic Instead, they stood calmly, waited patiently, and carried on with such poise. The
courage of standing tall in front of an audience even during a hiccup, that small moment spoke volumes
about what they're learning at Kidz Kollege- resilience, confidence, and adaptability! Ready for the real
world.<br/>
Thank you for helping our children grow, not just academically, but emotionally and socially too.<br/>
Love, </p>

                  kids sports day. <br/>
                  The event was a huge success and my child had an absolute blast participating in all the 
                  activities. <br/>
                  From the well-organized games  everything was top-notch and we truly appreciate all the 
                  effort that went into making the day so special for the kids. <br/>
                  It was great to see them having fun, being active, and enjoying each other's company.  
                  Thank you also to the  Teachers , volunteers and coaches who dedicated their time and 
                  energy to ensuring that everything ran smoothly. Your hard work and dedication did not go 
                  unnoticed and we are so grateful for all that you do for our children. <br/>
                  Overall, it was a fantastic day and we are already looking forward to next year's sports day. 
                  Thank you again for creating such wonderful memories for our kids.</p>

                  forth throughout the year for the growth and development of my child, Aaryavi<br/>
                  The dedication and commitment shown by Ms Zainab and Ms Janki, staff, and

                  experience but also instilled a love for education and a sense of curiosity. <br/>
                  Thank you for your unwavering dedication to creating an enriching and supportive 
                  atmosphere for all students. Your efforts are deeply appreciated and do not go unnoticed.

                  dedication and hard work in shaping not just my children's academic abilities, but also 
                  their character and values. Your contributions to their lives are immeasurable, and they will

                  I came home yesterday and have been thinking of your speech. I am so glad so many ears had the opportunity to listen to certain facts.<br/>
                  Our time on earth is limited. The time spent with our kids is even shorter. We can only expect children to learn from us. The bottom line is that modern parenting is all about using the family's unique passions, values, TT and beliefs to guide parenting decisions that lead to raising good kids and building a close bond with them at the same time.<br/>
                  Children should be encouraged to grow socially, emotionally and intellectually.  Like I always say - parenting is one of the most difficult tasks adults do but it's also the most rewarding. I saw so many stars shining during broad daylight yesterday.<br/>
                  Well done to every home that nurtures such beautiful individuals. Thank you to the entire school who further enrich our kids with the values that come from our homes.</p>

                <p class=" m-0 text-muted ">For the age group of 4 to 5, I feel they were highly coordinated. The performance was eye pleasing. Having seen most of them from a young age it's wonderful to see them all demonstrate their dance skill and teamwork with Days and weeks of rehearsals. I strongly feel Stage performances help the young to think outside of the box and understand how to appraise a situation. They become more self-confident because of participating. In fact, performing arts have been regarded as one of the best methods of improving one's self-confidence and self-esteem over time.  I have always felt very secure with Aarsh being in school at Kidz Kollege and the person she has turned out to has yet again confirmed my choice of school! Well done all!</p>
