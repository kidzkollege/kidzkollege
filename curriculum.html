They develop life skills that include problem solving, reasoning, negotiation and many others from  experiences they encounter. They also develop newly acquired cognitive skills and become increasingly able to face challenges, listen to others and execute positive social skills. This is the time when they also learn to become young authors through creative writing skills, fluent readers, and explorers through unit of inquiry and science themes. </p></div>
